    "What is Time Complexity?\n",
    "When solving a problem, there may be multiple approaches (codes) to achieve the desired result. The concept of time complexity helps us evaluate & compare these approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, allowing us to determine which one is more efficient. It’s a crucial metric that often becomes a key focus during technical interviews. Mainly because it demonstrates the effectiveness of a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, it might seem to represent the time a machine takes to execute a piece of code. However, this is a misconception. It’s more about the code than the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity measures how the time required to execute a code changes as the size of the input grows. It is independent of the machine used to execute the code & focuses solely on the algorithm’s behavior with increasing input size. This makes it a universal metric to compare algorithms."
